# o²S²PARC: Reusable Models of Visceral Nerve Stimulation

What is Visceral Nerve Stimulation (VNS)? 
- Stimulating visceral nerves can be utalized as a theraputic neuromodulation thearpy for a wide range of medical conditions. Here we are specifially focusing on the Vagus nerve in the pelvis. 

What's the problem or gap with VNS?
- There is poor interface design, stimulation selectivity, and low recording signal-to-noise ratio. 

How do we fix this? 
- New therapties are needed to advance the development of VNS in bioelectronic medicine. We have created a computational pipeline for modeling Visceral Nerve Ensemble Recroding & Stimulation (ViNERS) to accelerate the development and applications of VNS technologies.

How to use ViNERS
1. we will step this through as we go 

Installation & Dependencies 
- i'll sparce these two out as we go and see where they fit best. But I'm just adding them here for now

Output 
- we will email you your results!

Additonal / planned features 
- all of the example readmes had these at the bottom. IDK what to do with this yet.
